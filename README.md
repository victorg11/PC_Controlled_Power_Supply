# PC_Controlled_Power_Supply

This repository contains important information regarding the PC controlled power supply assembled in Spring 2018. This project was completed on a three month timeline with two additional team members.

Project features:
- Can supply voltages ranging 2 to 14 V.
- Capable of withstanding loads up to 1.5 A.
- Voltages and currents are adjustable via mounted buttons on encasing and USB serial connection using the standard SCPI instrumentation protocol.
- Sampled voltages and currents are displayed on an LCD touchscreen display using the SPI protocol.
